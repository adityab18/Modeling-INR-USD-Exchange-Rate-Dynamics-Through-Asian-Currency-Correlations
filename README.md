# Modeling INR/USD Exchange Rate Dynamics Through Asian Currency Correlations

This project focuses on predicting the INR to USD exchange rate by leveraging the influence of other Asian currency exchange rates against the US Dollar. Since currencies are often interlinked due to regional trade, economic policies, and market trends, analyzing multiple Asian currencies together provides a better understanding of INR/USD fluctuations.

The dataset contains exchange rate values of different currencies with respect to the US Dollar (USD). Using this multivariate dataset, the project applies statistical and machine learning models to:

Identify correlations between Asian currencies and INR/USD

Build predictive models for INR/USD using other Asian currency values as features

Evaluate model performance with metrics like RMSE, MAE, and RÂ²
